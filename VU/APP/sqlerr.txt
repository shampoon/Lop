!  Network errors for ODBC drivers
!  Any error received from an ODBC driver that indicates a lost connection 
!  should go here.  
!
!  If it's a single code, there should be a single number on the line.
!  If using a range, should be 2 numbers seperated by a comma, low number 1st.
!
!  There can be a maximum combination of 100 single errors and ranges
!  (combined)
!
!  This file should be placed in the Application ( eg c:\dynamics\app ) directory
!  of the Dynamics system.  If the driver does not have a problem with 
!  determining network errors, this file is not needed.
